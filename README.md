# Social-Media-Modelling

This project will create a simulation for a generic social media platform.

The aim is to analyse how different algorithms for sorting users effects the kinds of messages generated.

The first phase of this project will focus on simulating user interaction with the platform:
  - Creating Posts
  - Interacting with Posts
  
 The second phase will focus on simulating individual user behaviour:
  - When would a user create a new post
  - When would a user comment on a post if they see it
  - What kind of post would a user make
  - Would a user like a post
  
 The third phase will focus on algorithm promotion of posts:
  - What different ways can an algorithm promote content
  - If a machine learning is used how do different end goals of the ML program effect the comments generated and seen by users.
